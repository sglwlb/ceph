v10.0.0
======

* The rbd CLI no longer accepts the deprecated '--image-features' option
  during create, import, and clone operations.  The '--image-feature'
  option should be used instead.

* The rbd legacy image format (version 1) is deprecated with the Jewel release.
  Attempting to create a new version 1 RBD image will result in a warning.
  Future releases of Ceph will remove support for version 1 RBD images.

* The default RBD image features for new images have been updated to enable
  the following: exclusive lock, object map, fast-diff, and deep-flatten.
  These features are not currently supported by the RBD kernel driver nor older
  RBD clients. These features can be disabled on a per-image basis via the RBD
  CLI or the default features can be updated to the pre-Jewel setting by adding
  the following to the client section of the Ceph configuration file:
    rbd default features = 1

* The 'send_pg_creates' and 'map_pg_creates' mon CLI commands are
  obsolete and no longer supported.

* A new configure option 'mon_election_timeout' is added to specifically
  limit max waiting time of monitor election process, which was previously
  restricted by 'mon_lease'.

* CephFS filesystems created using versions older than Firefly (0.80) must
  use the new "cephfs-data-scan tmap_upgrade" command after upgrading to
  Jewel.  See 'Upgrading' in the CephFS documentation for more information.

v9.3.0
======
* Some symbols wrongly exposed by librados in v9.1.0 and v9.2.0 were removed.
  If you compiled your own application against librados shipped with these
  releases, it is very likely referencing these removed symbols. So you will
  need to recompile it.
